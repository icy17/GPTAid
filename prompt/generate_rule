source code of `FUNC_NAME`:
```
SOURCE_CODE
```

Please analyze the source code of the API `FUNC_NAME` and all the information provided before it. Then, respond with the following tasks:

Task 1: Based on the analysis of the source code, provide a concise description of the functionality of the function.

Task 2: Locate the code related to the Parameter_Info `PARA_NAME`.

Task 3: Identify the security rules that should be observed for the Parameter_Info to prevent misuse of the API `FUNC_NAME`. For each rule, include code snippets that demonstrate a violation of the rule:

1. Please provide detailed and specific descriptions for each rule. Clearly indicate which specific operations relate to the Parameter_Info. If a rule can apply to multiple operations that breach the rule, please make it more specific.

2. Each rule should focus on describing only one behavior if possible. If a rule encompasses multiple behaviors, please break it down into distinct rules.

3. Each rule should correspond to a separate violation code.

4. In cases where you're unsure about certain code details, you can suggest all possible rules, whether accurate or not, based on your knowledge database about potential API misuse.

5. Each violation code should contain at least one call to `FUNC_NAME`

6. Follow this format for each rule: Begin with an Arabic numeral, then describe the rule content (e.g., "1. Rule description"). Provide a corresponding violation code enclosed in triple backticks like this:
```
//Violation Code
```
